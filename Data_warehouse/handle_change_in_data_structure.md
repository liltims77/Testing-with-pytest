Handling changes in data structure (also known as schema evolution) in a data warehouse is a common and critical challenge. 
It involves strategies to ensure that your data warehouse continues to operate smoothly even when source data formats or schemas change. 
Here's how you can handle it:

🔁 1. Use a Schema Evolution Strategy
Choose a strategy based on how you want to handle schema changes:


Strategy	Description	Example Use Case
Schema-on-read	Data structure is interpreted at read time, not write time	Ideal for data lakes (e.g., using Parquet or JSON files)
Schema-on-write	Data must match schema before inserting into the warehouse	Preferred in traditional data warehouses like Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery

🔍 2. Track Schema Changes with Metadata
Maintain a schema registry or versioning system:

Track column additions, removals, or changes.

Store historical schema snapshots in a metadata layer or tool like dbt, DataHub, or Apache Atlas.

🔧 3. ETL/ELT Adaptability
Update your ETL/ELT processes to detect and adapt to schema changes:

Use tools like dbt, Apache Airflow, or Fivetran that support schema change detection.

In custom ETL scripts, use logic to:

Detect new columns (e.g., via schema comparison).

Flag breaking changes (e.g., datatype changes).

Alert or auto-update mappings.

🏗️ 4. Use Flexible Table Designs
Use design patterns that can absorb changes:

a. Wide Tables (nullable columns)
Add new columns as NULLABLE.

Advantage: Easy column addition.

Downside: May result in sparse data.

b. JSON Columns
Store dynamic or semi-structured data (e.g., in BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake).

Pros: High flexibility.

Cons: Harder to query and index.

c. EAV Model (Entity-Attribute-Value)
Store attributes as rows instead of columns.

Useful in highly dynamic schema environments.

Downside: Complex queries.

🔁 5. Use Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)
For dimensional tables:

Use SCD Type 2 to preserve history when the structure or content changes.

Helps track changes in business terms, not just schema.

🛡️ 6. Add Monitoring & Alerting
Monitor ETL failures due to schema mismatch.

Set up alerts when new fields appear in source systems.

Tools: Airflow, Monte Carlo, Great Expectations.

✅ 7. Implement Data Validation
Use automated tests to check:

Column presence

Data types

Nullability

Constraints

Tools: dbt tests, Great Expectations, pytest

💡 Example Scenario
You're loading from a T24 table, and the source adds a new column account_status. Your ELT process can:

Detect schema change (via INFORMATION_SCHEMA or manual config).

Add account_status column to staging table.

Modify the transformation logic to include this column.

Propagate it to the data warehouse layer.

Document and test it.
